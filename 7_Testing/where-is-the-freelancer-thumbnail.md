Good question — when you’re running **A/B testing for thumbnails on YouTube**, where you find and manage your test depends on **how** you’re doing it:

---

### 🧩 **If you’re using YouTube’s built-in A/B Testing (via YouTube Studio > Test & Compare):**

YouTube has started rolling out a native A/B testing tool called **“Test & Compare”** for thumbnails.

Here’s how to check it:

1. Go to **YouTube Studio → Content → Videos**.
2. Find the video you’re testing.
3. Click the **“Analytics”** icon or open the **Details** page.
4. If you have access to **“Test & Compare”**, you’ll see a section labeled **“Thumbnail Test & Compare.”**

   * It shows all versions of the thumbnails you’re testing.
   * You’ll see metrics like **impressions, click-through rate (CTR)**, and **watch time**.
   * YouTube will automatically declare a “winner” after enough data is gathered.

> 🧠 Note: Not everyone has access yet — YouTube is still rolling this out gradually (as of late 2025).

### 🧰 **If you’re using a third-party A/B tool (like TubeBuddy or vidIQ):**

Then your thumbnail test data **won’t show up in YouTube Studio**.

Instead:

* Go to **TubeBuddy Dashboard → A/B Tests → Active Tests**
  or
* **vidIQ → Split Testing → Thumbnails**

Those dashboards will show:

* The two (or more) thumbnails being tested
* Performance comparison (CTR, watch time, engagement)
* Which variant is winning

---

### 🔎 **If you uploaded multiple thumbnails but don’t see the test:**

* YouTube may not have processed the experiment yet.
* Make sure you **clicked “Start test”** after uploading both thumbnails.
* Only one thumbnail appears publicly at a time — YouTube rotates them behind the scenes.

Would you like to tell me which tool you used — YouTube Studio’s native test, TubeBuddy, or something else? I can guide you directly to where your thumbnail data is shown.
