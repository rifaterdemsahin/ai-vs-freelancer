(Silence) Oh, dear!

(...)

Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear!

(...)

Yes.

(...)

(Silence)

(...)

Hey, everyone, who is watching this video?

(...)

I can't find anything playing right now.

(...)

If you have been following my journey, do you know that I have cycled through? (Silence)

(...)

Hiring teams, going solo, using AI, and everything in between.

(...)

(Silence) Today, I'm sharing the actual playbook that is working right now.

(...)

(Silence)

(...)

This isn't a LinkedIn fantasy. It is what is real in 2025, November.

(...)

(Silence) I have built systems across three different markets.

(...)

(Silence) IT contracting, video production, and now AI engineering. (Silence) (Silence) And I have trained with professionals in the background, and now I'm currently automating everything with Eunator.

(...)

(Silence) (Silence)

(...)

And here is actually what really works and what really wins.(...) (Silence)

(Silence)

(...)

When I started, I threw the budget at people. I was making good money from contracting, so I was ready to spend the money.

(...)

My goal was to create a team and build it and make it work.

(...)

I was excited to get a designer, video editor, operations people. I wanted to do the wall setup.

(...)

I was very optimistic. I will be able to do this customer discovery and the initial product validation. That was brilliant. Use a team. (Silence)

(...)

In the beginning, I was very naive. I thought I hit the Golden Rush. I will be able to come out through this.

(...)

But here is a brutal truth. It broke down in the couple of years and I was unable to make it work.

(...)

For me, in the video production phase, the 24-hour ping-pong match was my revision process during different time zones.

(...)

The video editing took weeks. I'm right now doing it in less than four hours. It took me four weeks to be able to complete even a simple video.

(...)

I was annoyed and the backhand automation with other developers because I was working in IT contracting just forget about it. It did not work.

(...)

Because one developer's framework didn't match the others and understanding it even took more. Because I was working in different markets, I was doing lots of tasks switching as well.

(...)

The disappointing thing was I paid for the human intuition but the reality is I got a human overhead instead.

(...)

The cost structure broke down as the project slowed down because if there is no cash in the bank you would not be able to progress your projects.

(...)

And also one of my mentors even told me going back and forth in video production was the main cost that was driving everything down.

(...)

So like everybody else my next idea was I'm gonna go all in on AI and do everything with the automation. That was my thought process. I was from a Goldman Sachs contract. I came from Microsoft using these AI technologies. I said I will go all in with the AI.

(...)

I use all sorts of tools. I use the Microsoft Logic Apps at that time. I use the Cloud. I use the DaVinci Resolve. I tried to rebuild everything from the scratch and I tried to do this customer discovery from the scratch.

(...)

But honestly I was thinking I was just an IT contractor not a full-time video editor or an AI person. So I had this M skilled mindset not an X skilled mindset.

(...)

Honestly I was still in an M skilled mindset. I thought I was just an IT contractor not a full-time video editor and AI could be delegated to somebody else.

(...)

I was self-aware that I started everything with an employee mindset not as a business mindset. I tried to do everything myself.

(...)

And I did not move on very fast and I did not pivot from that mindset soon enough.

(...)

My learning curve also ate all the budgets that I didn't have and it made me shut down my own studio for the video production.

(...)

What was the real problem? My real problem was me. I was very irrational about automation and irrational about planning.

(...)

For me I was getting overwhelmed doing rough cuts, scheduling, iterating on the content.

(...)

Everything done by myself inefficiently because I didn't have the framework to work with the humans or nor with the AI. No process meant no consistency in my own workflows. So I was a bit defeated.

(...)

And I was getting exhausted under the chaos and I was becoming unhappy not satisfied on what I was working with.

(...)

Everything shifted when I moved my mindset from the known state to the unknown state.

(...)

I was in my contracts in video production and in the AI engineering.

(...)

Here is this real system that actually works right now.

(...)

As soon I understood I was very irrational. People can look at me as a computer scientist and can...

I think I'm very rational, I'm very very irrational. I knew that I was unable to stop on my own. I was always changing and pivoting the ideas and I did not know where to stop and honestly I did not want to stop changing my direction.

(...)

So the AI for repetitive and logical time consuming work

(...)

To be clear, AI is great for the repetitive, logical and time consuming work.

(...)

Such as the NA10 workflows that I'm using it for IT contracting for repetitive tasks such as email pipelines, content scheduling, it works like HR.

(...)

Such as I build a team to be able to get all the recruiter emails. Right now NA10 is doing it and putting it to a list automatically without me going back and forth and talking with the teams.

(...)

For the strategic side, the cloud for building customer delivery frameworks and customer discovery, it is great. I can give my target audience, I can give my previous videos and I will be able to create a script, the one that I'm reading right now, very easily. And it knows where to stop. Unlike myself, I will be changing the script all the time.

(...)

Since I worked in different markets with different customer needs, it was very good at creating the structure for me by using the AI.

(...)

So I stopped working on what the AI was doing. I kept on pivoting and I also used the AI at real time. Understanding the shifting and juggling these tasks at the same time was putting extra stress on me. I gave it to the AI. I kept on versioning myself but once I'm in front of the prompter I will read the last script that I got.

(...)

And also I stopped using only one tool to be able to do everything. Right now I'm using the Kamba and DaVinci resolve at the same time. I'm using the Kamba to be able to get the footages and using the DaVinci's AI features on the local to be able to do the rough cuts, the transcript and the assembly. And I'm ok as it's changing all the time.

(...)

So the good thing is what I did in the background for the IT projects that I was working on to become an IT AI engineer from the DevOps background in the IT contracting. I created a delivery pilot framework to put everything together, even my video production process as well.

(...)

It helped me align all my git repositories and gave me an understanding where I am at the real world, how I'm going to the imaginary and how I'm using the symbols.

(...)

And with the rise of all AI tools inside the Visual Studio in Obsidian everything becomes a reusable prompt for my own workflow to be able to transform it.

(...)

So what about the humans, the teams that I got? Humans are great for the taste, that's very very important. We want to be able to...

back to the real world by being able to connect all the dots. The Lacan calls this the joy cells.

(...)

This is the critical strategic direction for us. We should not rush the things. We need to make sure any project that we are working on, we are going to move from the i to t to m to x and we want to make sure that we are enjoying this journey as we move along.

(...)

If you are working with a human you can easily ask, "Should we pivot this angle?" That's a good question to go over it with a human, not with an AI, because it has the taste and it will be able to give you the real-time emotional feedback.(...) Also in this journey I read the David Hopkins MOOC. Also in this journey I read the book of David Hopkins Map of Consciousness. I realized the humans at a low energy level are very good at blaming and shaming and I understood I will be able to leverage this.

(...)

So for your practical use you can use creative judgment if you have a thick skin and if you are able to learn from it.(...) So my real world feedback is my team would actually use this or not or give me the feedback or not is the critical question while I'm hiring a new team. I want to make sure I'm always collecting constructive feedback.

(...)

If you are also thinking about creating a team

Don't do this in the beginning of the customer development process. Build it at the end. The company building is an end stage process. In the beginning, try to collect this feedback as much as you can in the discovery and the validation process from the YouTube, from the outside world, not from your internal teams. This is what I learned.

(...)

(Silence)

(...)

Also, right now with all these AI advancements, what you can do is you can get very easy fast reviews for your scripts, for your code with the AI. So use those tasks for the AI. Don't go over them with the humans. (Silence)

(...)

As David Hawkins teaches the unknown and the known, embrace the power of the unknown and try to reach the known stage with the humans. Give the unknown to the machines and try to reach the known with the humans and use their critical judgment and the test. (Silence)

(...)

When a human contractor reviews what I do for the architecture and tests the edge cases, it is 10x faster for anyone to be able to do what I have given you. Use the machines in the unknown stage with the AI.

(...)

They call it the Vibe programming. Then use the humans in a process called agentic programming. Create all these structures, I called it the delivery pilot, and make sure they can follow up the structure.

(...)

(Silence)

(...)

Because what we are good at as a human is, we are good at testing and giving real-time feedback. We will be able to do this without knowing it in an unconscious state. (Silence)

To be reflective of myself, I understood that the feedback is in me. When I create the videos, if nobody is watching, it means I'm getting the feedback. You don't need to hire a big team to be able to reach that conclusion.(...) You just need to learn how to read the YouTube numbers, the impressions, click-through rates and the average view duration.

(...)

And let's be honest, the market has shifted, the cheese has moved between the 2024 and 2025. In IT we had this big recession. I have seen the short-term contracts are off, the borrowing market went down. So my main cash cow is the short-term contracts. I had to turn back and fix everything that I had there to make sure that it is still moving. But I realized that I need to move to video production and finally to the AI engineering and use them all at the same time.

(...)

Because most freelancers and contractors I knew either started working for the government or starting doing the Uber. They either adapted or they disappeared from the marketplace.

(...)

To be strategic, you hire more humans to build more systems without the constant headcount rising is not a question you should ask yourself.

(Silence)

(...)

So my strategy shifted from hire more humans to build systems that scale without constant headcount and without extra costs. (Silence)

(...)

And that is a critical question mark for enterprises. They really need to reach there at a time without getting disappearing from the marketplace.

(...)

(Silence)

(...)

So for the practical use case, I'm automating work that used to be done by virtual assistant I hired from freeroylancer.com, fiverr.com from Upwork. (Silence) For the tasks such as reading emails and answering them, doing the job applications.(...) (Silence)

(...)

Now I have created templates to be able to do them with an Aton and I have some manual work that I got to do without hiring those teams.

(...)

(Silence)

(...)

For me to be productive, I'm building the top 10 AI courses to teach others how to use this hybrid model as well. Being able to use the unknown to the known in real time. (Silence)

(...)

I'm doing it for myself using the AI for production plans, post production plans and the production stages in between for the IT contracting for video production as well as in AI engineering. So you should also take a look at it as well. (Silence)

(...)

But I'm slowing down a bit more and more deliberately. Do not rush.

(...)

(Silence) I'm testing the pure AI versus the human guided workflow such as I'm creating the top nails for these videos and I'm also... (Silence)

always testing it in the background, which I will share in the comments as a git repo so you can go over it as well.

(...)

I'm measuring the time of the delivery and the consistency per unit.

(...)

I slow down one video every week. I'm not trying to create a video every single day. I'm looking at the average watch time, click-through rates and the impressions to make it better.

(...)

Also as you mentioned, I worked in multiple markets so it could be confusing for you a little bit. I thought everybody will become an AI engineer two years ago, then I realized it's not possible.

(...)

And I understood, I realized I need to help other professionals to advance in their careers by using the AI and become smarter.

(...)

That's a much wider market and YouTube is a medium for a wider market. So if the medium is the message, I will follow up the medium.

(...)

So I've pivoted from DevOps to AI engineering and now I help professionals to become smarter using the AI.

(...)

That is the main value proposition and I'm working on this with the AI to be able to do the initial iterations and looking at the numbers on YouTube to make sure that if I'm going to do correct direction.

(...)

I didn't get stuck with the same offering because the world is changing all the time. If I got stuck at DevOps, which was rising at the time, 10 years ago, I will have all these egos that are getting attached. I will not be able to write this AI wave that is coming on right now.

(...)

I am changing as

and I'm using AI to support this unknown process.

(...)

So what is the answer? AI or humans?

(...)

Don't choose, do not make any decision.

(...)

Build a hybrid engine. I did it and you should do the same as well.

(...)

Here is the three-step framework that you can easily follow.

(...)

First I create a plan with the AI and stick with that. It is rational, I am irrational, I will stick with the plan that AI has created.

(...)

I know the unknown is good and I know the known is good too as well.

(...)

For you to become wiser, you need to know how to execute, when to execute. You need to know unknown is there for you to create.

(...)

For step two, this is the critical part where the humans come in.(...) We use the taste and the judgment coming in, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. The blame and shame is a leverage point.

(...)

You have to embrace it and accept the humans as where they are. That is very very critical for you. You have to have a high energy to be able to accept what is going on around you.

(...)

For the last step, use frameworks to be able to capture everything. I created a delivery pilot framework to be able to put everything together to make it sense for myself.

(...)

So, I'm getting all these new projects in and learning to become an engineer, an AI engineer. I'm creating all these courses and the videos and doing my day-to-day work in IBM, I will put everything together in this delivery framework structure.

(...)

I created this framework, you can go and pull it. It is an easy winner for me, I hope it helps you as well.

(...)

So the winner is the person who automates rationality and amplifies the human creativity. Not only one of them, use both of them at the same time.

(...)

We have to use the known and the unknown at the same time.

(...)

That is what I'm doing in the customer discovery at a scale to be able to build a business from this YouTube channel, from the courses and from the enterprise work that I do.

(...)

I started to see some numbers moving on YouTube, not huge numbers, but at least some numbers that are moving. It's a good sign for me to be able to see, okay, there is some feedback here and I know where to look.

(...)

I hope you will follow up and subscribe so you will see these numbers moving up as well, not just me.

(...)

And that is how I'm building the top 10 AI courses in time so you can go ahead and take it for yourself as well.

(...)

For every contractor, freelancer, solo entrepreneur or an employee, if you want to be able to advance your career, feel free to subscribe to the channel. I will make sure you will become smarter by watching the content that I create.

(...)

So as I know, your edge isn't choosing.

between if I only go with AI or if you only go with the humans.

(...)

Your edges combining them strategically and capturing the framework so you do not repeat the same errors again and again.

(...)

I'm building all this in public. You can go and put my repos in GitHub and test this on your end.

(...)

I created a repo for this video as well. Go ahead and assess yourself. Go ahead and see if you are on the AI spectrum or if you are on the human spectrum where you are and what you got to do. Feel free to reach out to the GitHub pages that I created down below which is free.

(...)

In the comments I would love to be able to see your hybrid wins and what you did.

(...)

Technically, I'm using the perplexity as my AI agent and giving my existing videos and asking where I should go to make sure that I create content that relates to you.

(...)

And I'm putting out everything into these AI courses that you can take for free and the coupon codes are in the description.

(...)

Take care, think for yourself, bye bye bye bye.
