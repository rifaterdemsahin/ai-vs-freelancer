* [cite_start]COMMENT: Breakdown_S11 |C:ResolveColorYellow |VO: The cost structure broke down as the project slowed down because if there is no cash in the bank you would not be able to progress your projects.

[cite: 23] [cite_start]Honestly I was still in an M skilled mindset.

* [cite_start]COMMENT: Mistake2_S14 |C:ResolveColorRed |VO: I was self-aware that I started everything with an employee mindset not as a business mindset. [cite: 26] I tried to do everything myself.

* [cite_start]COMMENT: TurningPoint_S16 |C:ResolveColorRed |VO: I was very irrational about automation and irrational about planning. [cite: 29] [cite_start]For me I was getting overwhelmed doing rough cuts scheduling iterating on the content. [cite: 30] [cite_start]Everything done by myself inefficiently because I didn't have the framework to work with the humans or nor with AI and I was getting exhausted under the chaos and I was becoming unhappy not satisfied on what I was working with.

* [cite_start]COMMENT: AIRole_S18 |C:ResolveColorRed |VO: To be clear AI is great for the repetitive logical and time consuming work such as the NA10 workflows that I'm using it for IT contracting for repetitive tasks such as email pipelines, content scheduling it works like a chart such as I build a team to be able to get all the recruiter emails. [cite: 34] [cite_start]Right now NA10 is doing it and putting it to a list automatically without me going back and forth and talking with the teams. [cite: 35] || GEMINI_PROMPT: SFX: Calm 'server' hum, 'Checkmark'. || B-ROLL GRAPHIC: Animated n8n workflow: 'Email' icon -> 'Filter' icon -> 'List' icon. Label: 'Repetitive Tasks: AUTOMATED'.

[cite: 44] [cite_start]That's a good question to go over it with a human not with an AI because it has the taste and it will be able to give you the real-time emotional feedback.

[cite: 57] [cite_start]I had to turn back and fix everything that I had there to make sure that it is still moving.
