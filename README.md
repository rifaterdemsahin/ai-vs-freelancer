# 🚀 Delivery Pilot Structure

This project uses a **seven-folder structure** representing a holistic development journey. Each folder has a specific purpose and guides a structured workflow.

## 📁 Folder Structure

### 🎯 `1_Real` — Objectives & Key Results
- **Premise:** Every project must begin with a clear, measurable goal.
- **Content:** High-level objectives and key results (OKRs).
- **Purpose:** Keep work aligned with tangible outcomes.

### 🗺️ `2_Environment` — Roadmap & Use Cases
- **Premise:** Goals need a path.
- **Content:** Project roadmap, milestones, learning modules, and real-world use cases.
- **Purpose:** Provide strategic direction and user-focused context.

### 🧠 `3_UI` — Knowledge & Skill Acquisition
- **Premise:** Development is a continuous learning journey.
- **Content:** Personal knowledge base for concepts, theories, design patterns, and skills.
- **Purpose:** Encourage growth and document key learnings.

### 📚 `4_Formula` — Guides & Best Practices
- **Premise:** Reuse proven solutions where appropriate.
- **Content:** Templates, coding patterns, style guides, and helpful snippets.
- **Purpose:** Improve consistency and speed of delivery.

### ⚙️ `5_Symbols` — Implementation & Code
- **Premise:** Where design and theory become working software.
- **Content:** Core application source code (Vite + React) and implementation artifacts.
- **Purpose:** Contains the runnable project and main codebase.

### 🐛 `6_Semblance` — Error Logging & Solutions
- **Premise:** Bugs are opportunities to learn.
- **Content:** Logs of errors, root causes, and resolutions.
- **Purpose:** Reduce repeated mistakes and accelerate debugging.

### ✅ `7_Testing` — Validation & Quality Assurance
- **Premise:** A project is complete only when validated.
- **Content:** Tests, QA documentation, and validation scripts.
- **Purpose:** Ensure quality and verify objectives are met.

## 📋 How to Use This Repository

1. 🎯 Start in `1_Real` to understand the goals and success criteria.
2. 🗺️ Consult `2_Environment` for the roadmap and use cases to plan work.
3. 🧠 Use `3_UI` and `4_Formula` for learning resources and coding standards.
4. ⚙️ Implement features in `5_Symbols`.
5. 🐛 Record and learn from errors in `6_Semblance`.
6. ✅ Write and run tests in `7_Testing` to validate changes.
