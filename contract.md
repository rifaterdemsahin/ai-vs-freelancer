Here is a service agreement based on the meeting summary provided.
Thumbnail A/B Test Service Agreement
This Agreement is entered into and effective as of October 27, 2025 (the "Effective Date"), by and between:
1.⁠ ⁠The Parties
 * The Client: Rifat (also referred to as "Mr. Iphard" / "Difat"), the owner of the YouTube channel.
   (Hereinafter referred to as the "Client")
 * The Provider: Yanaure (Nour), representing their team including Tarek.
   (Hereinafter referred to as the "Provider")
2.⁠ ⁠Background & Purpose
Following a meeting on October 27, 2025, the Client expressed interest in testing the Provider's thumbnail design services. The Provider offered a "skin in the game" proposal to demonstrate the value of their service.
This Agreement outlines the terms for a single A/B test of one (1) video thumbnail, where payment is entirely contingent upon the measurable success of the Provider's work.
3.⁠ ⁠Scope of Work
 * Provider's Deliverable: The Provider shall design and deliver to the Client one (1) custom video thumbnail ("Thumbnail B") for a video chosen by the Provider (identified during the meeting as the Client's "last video" as of the Effective Date).
 * Client's Deliverable: The Client will use their own AI-generated thumbnail for the same video ("Thumbnail A").
 * The Test: The Client shall use YouTube's built-in A/B testing feature to run Thumbnail A and Thumbnail B against each other simultaneously.
4.⁠ ⁠Term
The A/B test shall run for a period of approximately fourteen (14) days from the date the Client successfully implements the test on the YouTube channel (the "Test Period").
5.⁠ ⁠Success Metric & Determination
 * Governing Metric: The "Winning Thumbnail" will be determined exclusively by the YouTube platform's A/B test algorithm.
 * Definition of "Win": The winner is the thumbnail that YouTube's algorithm statistically determines to have performed better based on viewer data (e.g., Click-Through Rate (CTR) and/or watch time).
 * Verification: The Client agrees to provide the Provider with a screenshot or verifiable access to the final results screen of the A/B test upon completion of the Test Period. The Client's personal opinion of the thumbnail shall not be a factor in determining the outcome.
6.⁠ ⁠Compensation (The "Skin in the Game" Model)
The parties agree to the following results-based payment structure:
 * Payment upon Success: If the Provider's "Thumbnail B" is declared the Winning Thumbnail by the YouTube A/B test results (per Section 5), the Client shall pay the Provider a one-time, flat fee of $20.00 USD.
 * No Payment: If the Client's "Thumbnail A" wins the A/B test, or if the A/B test results are inconclusive (a "tie" as determined by YouTube), the Provider shall be paid $0.00 USD.
 * No Upfront Fees: Both parties explicitly agree that no upfront payment, deposit, or partial payment shall be made. Payment is 100% contingent on the successful outcome defined in Section 6.1.
7.⁠ ⁠Independent Contractor Status
The Provider is an independent contractor. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating an employer-employee relationship, partnership, or joint venture between the parties.
8.⁠ ⁠Entire Agreement
This document represents the entire agreement between the Client and the Provider, superseding all prior verbal discussions (including the meeting summary of October 27, 2025, which this Agreement is based upon).
